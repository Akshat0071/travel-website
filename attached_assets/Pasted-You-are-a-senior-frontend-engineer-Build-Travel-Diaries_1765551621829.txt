Listing page requirements

Sections:

Header & breadcrumbs

Hero banner: short intro to Travel Diaries, small CTA to “Write with us” or “Submit your diary” (link to contact/admin)

Filter bar: tags (spiritual, trek, honeymoon, family), months, author filter, search keywords

Featured diary: top story prominently displayed (large card)

Diaries grid/list: cards with thumbnail, title, excerpt, read time, tags, “Read More” button

Infinite scroll / Load more with Framer Motion reveal for new items

Sidebar (desktop): popular diaries, newsletter signup, small map showing regions covered
