You are a senior frontend engineer. Build a Contact page for a Tours & Taxi website using:

Next.js (App Router)

Tailwind CSS

Framer Motion

Cloudinary for any small images/icons

Accessible & SEO-friendly markup

Create app/contact/page.tsx and components under /components/contact/*.

Contact page requirements (sections)

Hero / Intro — short trust-building headline, phone & WhatsApp quick CTA

Contact Cards — address (Chintpurni, Himachal), phone with click-to-call, WhatsApp button, support email, office hours

Contact Form (primary):

Fields: name, phone, email, subject, message, service type (select: package/taxi/enquiry), optional file upload (upload travel doc or itinerary request PDF)

Client-side validation (zod or simple) and inline error display

Spam protection: invisible reCAPTCHA (mention in README how to enable) or simple honeypot field

On submit:

POST to /api/contact (serverless endpoint) which saves to Supabase (or stubbed JSON file) and returns success

Send email notification to admin via SendGrid (or log to console in demo)

Optionally return a ticket/reference number

Show success toast + “Chat Now on WhatsApp” button

Office Location Map — embedded Google Maps iframe or static image for demo

FAQ mini-section — 5 short FAQs about bookings & taxi service

Support Response Times & SLA — short box: “We respond within 12 hours”

Footer CTA — newsletter subscribe or quick booking

UX & Animations

Animate input focus with subtle outline and shadow.

Form submit: show animated loader then success check animation.

Use aria-live="polite" for submission status messages.

On mobile, sticky contact CTA bar at bottom with phone & WhatsApp.

Technical details

lib/contact.ts helper for client-side form submission & validation.

/api/contact serverless route stub that validates and stores incoming data in a demo JSON or posts to Supabase (comment both options).

File upload: small files forwarded to Cloudinary via signed server API; if using demo mode, accept file but do not upload.

Output requirements

Provide app/contact/page.tsx, components/contact/ContactForm.tsx, components/contact/ContactCard.tsx, lib/contact.ts, and pages/api/contact.js (or app/api/contact/route.ts) stub.

Provide README snippet showing how to wire SendGrid / Supabase for production (env vars).

Ensure form accessible labels and appropriate input types.
