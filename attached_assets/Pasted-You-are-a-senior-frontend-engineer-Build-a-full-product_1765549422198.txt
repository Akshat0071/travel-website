You are a senior frontend engineer.
Build a full production-quality Home Page for a Tours, Travel Packages & Taxi Services website using:

Next.js 14 (App Router preferred)
Tailwind CSS
Framer Motion
Cloudinary-hosted images (use placeholder URLs)
Mobile-first responsive design
High-end Himachal travel aesthetic (mountains, temples, rivers, adventure)

Layout must look visually premium with improved colors, fonts, spacing, and modern UI patterns:

Use Playfair Display for headings, Inter for body text
Color palette: Himalayan blue, forest green, saffron accents, warm neutrals
Smooth rounded sections, soft shadows, improved spacing, more appealing layout structure

Create a complete app/page.tsx (or /src/app/page.tsx) plus all reusable components in /components/home/...

The home page must use semantic HTML, clean layout, perfect spacing, animations, SEO-friendly structure.
