You are a senior frontend engineer. Build production-grade Packages pages for a Tours & Taxi website using:

Next.js 14 (App Router)

Tailwind CSS

Framer Motion

Cloudinary images (use placeholder URLs provided below)

Mobile-first responsive design

Accessible & SEO-friendly markup

Produce two routes:

/packages — Packages listing (grid, filters, search, sort)

/packages/[slug] — Package detail

Place all components under /components/packages/*. Provide full, working React/Next.js code (no pseudocode). Ensure pages work with static sample data (array or JSON) so they render out-of-the-box.

Data & sample Cloudinary images (use these placeholders)

Use these placeholder Cloudinary URLs in the sample data for each package image (replaceable later):

UX details

Clicking a PackageCard navigates to /packages/[slug] (replace slug in sample data).

Book Now opens a modal to collect optional name/phone then POST to /api/leads (client-side stub) and then redirects to WhatsApp link with prefilled message.

Filters work in UI with client-side state (no backend required for demo).

Hero Banner — large banner image gallery slider (Framer Motion + swipe)

Gallery thumbnails below hero

Download itinerary PDF button (Cloudinary PDF placeholder)

Day-by-Day Itinerary — accordion or timeline with timeline markers (expand/collapse)
