You are a senior frontend engineer. Build Blog pages for the site with a distinct content/SEO focus (shorter, informational posts vs. Travel Diaries). Use these technologies:

Next.js (App Router)

Tailwind CSS

Framer Motion

Cloudinary images (placeholders below)

react-markdown for markdown blog rendering

Accessible & SEO-minded markup

Create:

app/blog/page.tsx — Blog listing (search, categories, featured posts)

app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx — Blog post detail (SEO-first)

Sample Cloudinary placeholders

Inline CTA blocks — e.g., “Book this package” cards inserted at logical places (optional)

Related posts — bottom section with cards

Comments — lightweight CTA to contact or use third-party like Disqus (optional)

SEO:

<title> and <meta description> from post frontmatter

Open Graph tags with og:image (Cloudinary)

JSON-LD Article schema with headline, author, datePublished, image

Share buttons: include WhatsApp share with prefilled message to share the post link

Use rehype plugins for external links target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer".

Ensure images use Next <Image /> or Cloudinary URLs and lazy-loading.
